## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
As a french student I had a very hard time looking at the Larousse website for word definitions. The website is crazy packed with very annoying adds, which make it very hard to focus on the definition. I wanted to create an interface to get the definitions in a cleaner visualization.
